# DEV_NOTES — Numera Android

## 2026-10-31 / v0.1.0 graphical and gameplay prototype

- Repository: `wwwrocket065-eng/Hello_World_`; branch: `numberfactory-android`; project: `numberfactory/`. The existing main branch and GlassStudy/Hello_World_ files are not edited.
- Confirmed source commits:
  - `8093a163c365f2b6adbb7d3cd7f9426a5da97925`: Canvas-based playfield, game simulation, number sources, conveyors, add/multiply machines, touch construction, pan/pinch, UI, local persistence.
  - `bdc23dc4b80a24577620e777af38c4c723060906`: GitHub Actions debug APK build and conditional public preview release.
- Appearance: original dark graphite/navy grid, moving turquoise conveyors, amber number tokens, violet adders, blue multipliers, ringed target hub, modern HUD, 6 touch tools.
- Initial production line: source 2 + source 3 -> addition -> conveyor -> hub targeting 5, 12 successful deliveries to complete level 1. Level 2 target 8; further balancing and unlocks remain to be implemented.
- Build conditions: Gradle 8.9 / AGP 8.7.3, Java 17, compileSdk 35, Android 8.0+ (minSdk 26); package `com.numera.factory` separate from other apps.
- Current verification: repository source writes succeeded. Build job result, publicly downloadable APK and real-device installation have NOT been verified; never claim these as complete without checking.
- CI planned output: `numera-v0.1.0-debug-apk` artifact; preview release tag `numera-v0.1.0-preview` only after successful build.
- Next: verify GitHub Actions run and fix build issues if any, install on Android, calibrate labels/touch hit areas; implement true two-input machines orientation, faster belts/upgrades, source deposits, later arithmetic operations and autosave optimizations.
